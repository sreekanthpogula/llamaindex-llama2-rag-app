# llamaindex-llama2-rag-app
This repository contains a simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application using LlamaIndex and Llama2 and Hugging Face.
It demonstrates how to set up a RAG system that can answer questions based on a set of documents.

## Features
- Uses LlamaIndex for document indexing and retrieval.
- Utilizes Llama2 for generating responses based on retrieved documents.
- Supports a simple command-line interface for querying the system.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`
- Access to Llama2 model (ensure you have the necessary permissions and API keys if required)
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llamaindex-llama2-rag-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd llamaindex-llama2-rag-app
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage
1. Prepare your documents in a directory (e.g., `documents/`).
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to ask questions based on the indexed documents.
4. To exit the application, type `exit`.
